Competitive Analysis:



There are some 3D snake games created and uploaded by people. I can find 
a lot of samples from Youtube. However, what I am trying to do is to create
the 3D wandering in a first person view, not from a third person view. It is
easier for players to understand the game. For most of the games that I see 
on Youtube, they are either too simple or too complicated. The simple one
has cheap graphing and the complicated one gives players a headache. I want
to create a game that is casual and fun to play with for a short time.
