This project is going to create a traditional Snake game in a 3D setting.
The project relies merely on Tkinter. (In other word, I have no module used)
Animation will be used as a primary super class that handles the animation.
The game features wandering on both 6 faces of a cube.
There will be items that snake can eat to grow, speed up, and die.
The field is not totally clean, there might be some hills and rocks
that snake just can go across.
Your total score will be stored, the highest score will be updated.
Hope you enjoy the game.
